A repo to hold my work for the Python Skills Accelerator with F2 '24 at the Recurse Center.

1. [Python Mastery](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery) 
2. [PyTudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)  
3. [Python Tricks](https://www.kalfaoglu.com/ceng113/Python-Programming/pythontricks.pdf)
4. [Problem Solving with Python](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/)
