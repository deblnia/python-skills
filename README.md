2. [PyTudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)  
3. [Python Tricks](https://www.kalfaoglu.com/ceng113/Python-Programming/pythontricks.pdf)
4. (I'm adding this one) [Problem Solving with Python](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/)
5. (I'm adding this one) [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)
