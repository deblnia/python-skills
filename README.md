A repo to hold my work for the Python Skills Accelerator with F2 '24 at the Recurse Center.

2. [PyTudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)  
3. [Python Tricks](https://www.kalfaoglu.com/ceng113/Python-Programming/pythontricks.pdf)
4. [Problem Solving with Python](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/) (Maybe only Ch5+ on this one) 
6. [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)
7. [Programming with Python](http://bilal-qudah.com/mm/Programming%20Python%20Fourth%20Edition.pdf)
8. [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans)
9. [Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

11. [Python Crash Course](https://khwarizmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eric_Matthes_Python_Crash_Course_A_Hands.pdf)

Missc References: 
- [This](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) is also a useful resource for the run-time complexity of common Python operations. 
- [This](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) is a nice list of Python design patterns and idioms.
