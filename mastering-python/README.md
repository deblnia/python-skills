# mastering-python 

I use a virtual environment to manage dependencies (mostly just `ipython` for a slightly nicer REPL). It seems to go stale locally, so a fresh install is probably best. Run the following in the `mastering-python` directory:  

```bash 
rm -rf venv/ # removes old installation 
python3 -m venv venv # recreates 
source venv/bin/activate # activates
```
